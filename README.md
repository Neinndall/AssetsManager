AssetsManager is a tool for League of Legends enthusiasts who need to analyze, manage, and track changes to game assets from PBE server updates. It goes beyond simple downloading, offering a powerful suite of features for deep asset analysis, a 3D model viewer, exploration, and monitoring for changes.

## ‚ú® Key Features

*   **Download automatically new assets**: Automatically detects and downloads new assets from PBE updates.
*   **Advanced WAD Comparator**: Compares WAD files between different versions to identify new, modified, or deleted assets.
*   **Powerful File Explorer**: Explore WAD with powerful tools with archives with a file tree interface and previews dozens of formats.
*   **3D Model Viewer**: Visualize 3D Models of champions with their animations and MapGeometry Environments with a built-in viewer.
*   **Asset Monitoring**: Tracks remote assets, JSON files, and the PBE server status for real-time updates.
*   **Version Management**: Manages and downloads diferentes versiones de LoL Game Client or Plugins.
*   **Audio Bank**: Explores audio banks (.wpk, .bnk), visualizes the event hierarchy with their names, and plays the associated sounds.

## ü¶æ Advanced Functionality

### Monitoring Suite (`MonitorWindow`)

AssetsManager now includes a powerful suite of tools to automatically track changes in game assets without manual intervention.

*   **File Watcher:** Monitor a list of remote JSON files for any updates. When a change is detected, the app automatically saves the old and new versions and logs the difference, allowing you to view the changes at any time.
*   **Asset Tracker:** Keep a persistent list of specific assets you want to track. The tool will periodically check their status (e.g., "OK", "Not Found", "Pending") in the background. It even includes fallback logic for assets with multiple possible extensions (like `.jpg` and `.png`).
*   **History View:** All detected changes from the File Watcher are saved in a persistent history. You can browse past changes, view the diffs, and manage the history log.
*   **Manage Versions:** A new tool that natively integrates with Riot's APIs to fetch and manage different client and game versions. It allows you to download version manifests, plugins, and even full game clients for specific PBE patches.

### 3D Model Viewer (`ModelWindow`)

Explore League of Legends 3D Models like never before.

*   **3D Models & MapGeometry:** Inspect 3D models of champions `.skn` with their animations `.anm` and MapGeometry Environments `.mapgeo`.
*   **Animation Playback:** Apply `.anm` (animation) files to a loaded skeleton to see the model come to life with full skinning support.
*   **Scene Control:** Manipulate the 3D camera, manage loaded parts, and inspect model geometry.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

*   [.NET 8.0 Runtime](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/thank-you/runtime-desktop-8.0.8-windows-x64-installer) (or higher) installed on your system.

## üõ†Ô∏è AssetsManager

AssetsManager is a tool for League of Legends enthusiasts who need to analyze, manage, and track changes to game assets from PBE server updates. It goes beyond simple downloading, offering a powerful suite of features for deep asset analysis, 3D viewer model, exploration, and monitoring for changes.

## ‚ú® Key Features

*   **Advanced WAD File Comparison:** Compare `.wad` archives between two PBE directories to identify new, modified, deleted, or renamed assets. Includes a side-by-side visual diff for image changes (`ImageDiffWindow`).
*   **Portable Comparison Packages:** Save comparison results asynchronously as a lightweight, self-contained package. This includes only the changed file chunks, allowing for easy sharing and review without the original PBE directories.
*   **Powerful PBE File Explorer:** Browse game files with a familiar file-tree interface, featuring a highly advanced real-time search to instantly filter results or navigate directly to any file or folder. The integrated previewer supports a wide range of formats, including textures (`.tex`, `.dds`), images (`.png`, `.svg`), text, audio, video, and provides a readable visualization for binary `.bin` files.
*   **3D Model Viewer:** A fully integrated tool to load and inspect 3D models (`.skn`), skeletons (`.skl`), and play animations (`.anm`) directly within the application.
*   **Automated Asset Downloading:** Efficiently compares local and server hashes to download only new or modified assets from Community Dragon.
*   **Flexible Asset Filtering:** Customize downloads by excluding file extensions and applying complex URL-based rules.
*   **Modern & Responsive Architecture:** Built with an event-driven, asynchronous-first approach to ensure a smooth, non-blocking user experience. It leverages Dependency Injection (DI) for a clean and maintainable codebase.

## ü¶æ Advanced Functionality

### Monitoring Suite (`MonitorWindow`)

AssetsManager now includes a powerful suite of tools to automatically track changes in game assets without manual intervention.

*   **File Watcher:** Monitor a list of remote JSON files for any updates. When a change is detected, the app automatically saves the old and new versions and logs the difference, allowing you to view the changes at any time.
*   **Asset Tracker:** Keep a persistent list of specific assets you want to track. The tool will periodically check their status (e.g., "OK", "Not Found", "Pending") in the background. It even includes fallback logic for assets with multiple possible extensions (like `.jpg` and `.png`).
*   **History View:** All detected changes from the File Watcher are saved in a persistent history. You can browse past changes, view the diffs, and manage the history log.
*   **Manage Versions:** A new tool that natively integrates with Riot's APIs to fetch and manage different client and game versions. It allows you to download version manifests, plugins, and even full game clients for specific PBE patches.

### 3D Model Viewer (`ModelWindow`)

Explore League of Legends 3D assets like never before.

*   **Model & Skeleton Loading:** Load `.skn` (mesh) and `.skl` (skeleton) files to view character and environment models.
*   **Animation Playback:** Apply `.anm` (animation) files to a loaded skeleton to see the model come to life with full skinning support.
*   **Scene Control:** Manipulate the 3D camera, manage loaded parts, and inspect model geometry.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

*   [.NET 8.0 Runtime](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/thank-you/runtime-desktop-8.0.8-windows-x64-installer) (or higher) installed on your system.

### Installation

1.  **Download the latest release:** Visit the [Releases page](https://github.com/Neinndall/AssetsManager/releases) (replace with your actual releases URL) and download the `AssetsManager.zip` file.
2.  **Extract the contents:** Unzip the downloaded file to your desired location (e.g., `C:\AssetsManager`).
3.  **Run the application:** Navigate to the extracted folder and run `AssetsManager.exe`.

## üìñ Usage

1.  **Configure Settings:** Open the `Settings` tab to set up your preferences, including hash synchronization, auto-copy, and backup options.
2.  **Select Directories:** In the `Home` tab, specify your "New Hashes Directory" and "Old Hashes Directory".
3.  **Start Download:** Click the "Start Download" button to begin the asset extraction and download process. The application will compare hashes and download only the necessary files.
4.  **Preview Assets:** Use the `Export` tab to preview specific asset types (images, audio, etc.) and download selected items.
5.  **Explore & Monitor:** Use the `Explorer`, `Comparator`, `Monitor`, and `Model Viewer` tabs to access the advanced features of the application.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

All application settings are managed through a dedicated `Settings` window and persisted in the `config.json` file. This allows for deep customization of the application's behavior to fit your workflow. Key configuration areas include setting default paths, automating core processes like hash management and backups, and fine-tuning the behavior of advanced features such as background monitoring services and application updates.
